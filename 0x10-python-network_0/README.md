## Learning Objectives

- **What a URL is:** 
  - A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is the address of a resource on the Internet.
  
- **What HTTP is:** 
  - HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is the protocol used for transmitting web pages over the Internet.

- **How to read a URL:**
  - Understanding the components of a URL such as the scheme, domain, port, path, query string, and fragment.

- **The scheme for a HTTP URL:**
  - The scheme indicates the protocol being used (e.g., `http`, `https`).

- **What a domain name is:**
  - A domain name is the human-readable address of a website (e.g., `example.com`).

- **What a sub-domain is:**
  - A sub-domain is a domain that is part of a larger domain (e.g., `blog.example.com`).

- **How to define a port number in a URL:**
  - A port number is defined after the domain name and separated by a colon (e.g., `example.com:8080`).

- **What a query string is:**
  - A query string is the part of a URL that contains data to be passed to web applications (e.g., `?name=John`).

- **What an HTTP request is:**
  - An HTTP request is a message sent by the client to the server to request data or action.

- **What an HTTP response is:**
  - An HTTP response is a message sent by the server back to the client, containing the requested data or the status of the request.

- **What HTTP headers are:**
  - HTTP headers are key-value pairs sent in both requests and responses that provide additional information about the request or response.

- **What the HTTP message body is:**
  - The HTTP message body contains the data being sent in a request or response.

- **What an HTTP request method is:**
  - HTTP request methods indicate the desired action to be performed on the resource (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

- **What an HTTP response status code is:**
  - HTTP response status codes indicate the result of the request (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found).

- **What an HTTP Cookie is:**
  - An HTTP Cookie is a small piece of data stored by the client's browser to maintain stateful information for web applications.

- **How to make a request with cURL:**
  - cURL is a command-line tool used to transfer data with URLs. It can be used to make HTTP requests by specifying the desired URL and options.

- **What happens when you type google.com in your browser (Application level):**
  - When you type `google.com` in your browser, the browser sends a DNS request to get the IP address of the server hosting the website. It then makes an HTTP request to that server and displays the response (usually an HTML page) in the browser.
